zyte_client.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thin wrapper around Zyte API (https://api.zyte.com/v1/extract) — the
PRIMARY scraping provider now that Scrape.do's credits are exhausted (see
config.SCRAPING_PROVIDER and checkers/common.py's fetch_page(), the
central function every checker/debug command routes through). Scrape.do's
own code path (checkers/common.py's build_scraper_url + a plain GET) is
left fully intact and unused while SCRAPING_PROVIDER="zyte" — flip that
flag back to "scrapedo" the moment Scrape.do credits are recharged, no
code changes needed on either side.

Zyte's API is a single POST endpoint with a JSON body, not a GET-able URL
with query params like Scrape.do's, and it returns the fetched page's HTML
wrapped in a JSON envelope (base64-encoded for a non-JS fetch, a plain
string for a JS-rendered one) rather than as the raw HTTP response body.
fetch_page() below hides all of that and returns a genuine httpx.Response
synthesized from Zyte's reply, so every existing call site's
resp.text / resp.status_code / resp.json() / resp.raise_for_status() usage
keeps working completely unchanged, regardless of which provider actually
served the fetch.

Parameter mapping to Zyte's request fields — the render_js/super_proxy/
geolocation mapping below is verified against Zyte's own documentation
(docs.zyte.com/zyte-api/usage/reference.html, http.html, browser.html,
features.html, extract/actions.html) via web search, since this sandbox
has no live network access to fetch those pages directly (direct WebFetch
of docs.zyte.com returns HTTP 403; WebSearch results cross-confirmed the
same field names/shapes across multiple independent snippets, the same
verification approach already used elsewhere in this codebase for
third-party API surfaces — see checkers/common.py's playWithBrowser
comment for precedent):

  render_js=True    -> "browserHtml": true (Zyte opens a real headless
                        browser; the response's "browserHtml" field is the
                        rendered HTML as a plain string, no decoding needed)
  render_js=False    -> "httpResponseBody": true (no browser; the
                        response's "httpResponseBody" field is the raw
                        HTTP response body, base64-encoded)
  super_proxy=True   -> ALSO forces the browser tier on, even for an
                        otherwise render_js=False site. Zyte API does NOT
                        expose an explicit "premium/residential proxy"
                        toggle the way Scrape.do's super=true does — its
                        proxy selection and anti-bot handling are automatic
                        and managed server-side per request (confirmed via
                        Zyte's own "Automate Proxy Management" / proxy-mode
                        docs). Forcing the full browser tier is the closest
                        verified "try harder against a block" lever Zyte's
                        request fields actually expose, so that's what
                        super_proxy maps to here. Flagged explicitly: unlike
                        the mappings above, this is a best-effort SEMANTIC
                        equivalence, not a literal 1:1 parameter match —
                        worth revisiting once real Zyte responses for a
                        currently-blocked site (e.g. RelianceDigital,
                        ShopAtSC) can be compared against what Scrape.do's
                        super=true used to return for the same URL.
  geolocation         -> always "IN" (matches build_scraper_url's geoCode=in)
  play_with_browser   -> translated to Zyte's "actions" list — see
                        _translate_actions below. Only exercised today by
                        RelianceDigital's DEBUG-ONLY fetch_with_pincode_
                        interaction (admin_handlers.py's /debugreliance2);
                        nothing in the live check cycle uses this.
  custom_wait_ms      -> appended as a trailing {"action": "waitForTimeout",
                        "timeout": <seconds>} action (Zyte's own docs give a
                        `{"action": "waitForTimeout", "timeout": 0}` example
                        — seconds, not ms, hence the /1000 conversion below).
                        Forces the browser tier on if not already active,
                        same reasoning as super_proxy above: an ignored wait
                        request would silently change OnePlus/Unicorn
                        Store's tuned behavior.
  wait_until          -> NOT translatable — Zyte's browser automation has no
                        direct equivalent to Puppeteer's waitUntil strategy
                        (networkidle0 etc.). Accepted but logged and
                        ignored; browserHtml mode already waits for the
                        page to settle by default, and custom_wait_ms above
                        covers the "extra settle buffer" half of what
                        wait_until+custom_wait_ms was doing together.
  set_cookies         -> translated to Zyte's requestCookies field (Zyte's
                        own docs describe this as an "experimental"
                        feature). Only exercised today by /debugreliance's
                        optional pincode-cookie trial (admin_handlers.py) —
                        every current production site's set_cookies is None
                        (see stock_checker.py's _PINCODE_COOKIE_SITES, an
                        empty frozenset).
  custom_headers      -> NOT translated (no current call site passes
                        custom_headers=True in production code — the only
                        reference is a standalone, unused test script for
                        the long-retired Croma checker). Raises
                        NotImplementedError if ever actually requested,
                        rather than silently dropping a real requirement.
