# Vijay Sales (vijaysales.com) deliberately NOT added — investigated and
# skipped, not "not yet built". Four separate diagnostic passes (via
# test_new_store_signals.py against real confirmed-OOS/in-stock product pages)
# each found a real reliability problem: JSON-LD offers.availability is
# static/stale (reads "InStock" on a confirmed-OOS page too); page-wide OOS
# text ("currently unavailable", "notify me") appears near the buy box on BOTH
# OOS and in-stock pages (likely a generic price-drop-alert widget, not real
# stock text); the Add to Cart button's disabled-attribute was INCONSISTENT
# across render modes for the same product (disabled=None at render=false,
# disabled='' at render=true) — a headless-browser hydration-timing artifact,
# not a real signal (the same trap that caused Croma's flip-flopping); and a
# dedicated stock-status class element found on the page ("instock__text")
# turned out to be identical + hidden (display:none) on both OOS and in-stock
# pages, i.e. dead/unused markup. A targeted search for Magento/Adobe
# Commerce's own internal GraphQL+MSI field names (stock_status, is_salable,
# salable_quantity) — the last, most specific hypothesis tried — also came
# back completely empty at both render modes, meaning the real stock data is
# most likely fetched via a separate XHR call after page load that's invisible
# to any HTML fetch regardless of render mode. Shipping a checker on any of
# the four unreliable signals would produce false alerts; skip until a better
# diagnostic approach is found or Vijay Sales changes its site architecture.

# Croma: RE-ADDED here. It was previously pulled from /add and /stores
# entirely (see git history) after its old HTML-scraping checker was
# confirmed to flip between correct and fully-inverted results across
# consecutive checks, then later degrade to reporting every product OOS,
# with no root cause ever identified — shipping that would produce false
# alerts (or false silence) for users. checkers/croma.py's scraping-based
# check() has since been replaced ENTIRELY with a direct call to Croma's
# own free internal inventory API (checkers.croma.check_via_api) — a
# structured JSON response, not page-text/DOM heuristics, so the specific
# failure mode above (an HTML-signal guess quietly going wrong) no longer
# applies the same way. Manually verified accurate against the live site
# for both in-stock and out-of-stock cases, so it's no longer in
# UNRELIABLE_SITES above either — automatic alerts are back on.

# official-store detour was built (and then reverted) as a result. Real
# screenshots later confirmed the true cause was a request-header mismatch
# (wrong Accept/Referer, missing x-skip-redirect), not the query param.
# With the headers fixed, location=<pincode> works for all 6 pincodes
# above AND any arbitrary /trackpickup pincode — no per-store internal
# Apple code needed at all.

# The official-store checker (run_apple_official_pickup_cycle) and
# /trackpickup (run_pickup_check_cycle) run on THIS separate, longer
# interval instead of the main CHECK_INTERVAL (see bot.py's
# stock_checker_loop) — real-world testing found APPLE_COOKIES' session
# was being invalidated (HTTP 541) after ~2 hours, and request VOLUME was
# identified as a likely contributing factor: on the old shared 5-minute
# CHECK_INTERVAL, even a single tracked Apple product generated ~144
# automated fulfillment-messages requests every 2 hours, arriving in
# tight parallel bursts (6 pincodes at once, every cycle). Running these
# on a longer, dedicated interval cuts total request volume roughly 3x at
# the default values below, without slowing down the main stock-check
# cadence for every other site/feature. Pickup-availability data going a
# few extra minutes stale is an acceptable tradeoff for meaningfully
# fewer automated hits against a cookie session already shown to be
# pattern-sensitive — see checkers/apple.py's check_pickup_at_official_
# stores for the complementary sequential-with-jitter + shared-connection
# changes (also part of reducing this endpoint's bot-like footprint).
# Reverted back to a fast 3-min default now that cookie freshness is handled
# by the Playwright-based auto-refresher below (real-browser-minted cookies,
# refreshed every APPLE_COOKIE_REFRESH_INTERVAL) rather than relying on one
# manually-pasted session surviving hours of use — see APPLE_COOKIE_REFRESH_*

# Raised 180 -> 900 (2026-07-28, when run_pickup_check_cycle/run_channel_

# each pincode check now launches a real headful Chromium browser via
# playwright_scraper, gated to MAX_CONCURRENT_CHECKS (see that service's
# own module) concurrent browsers, with up to APPLE_PICKUP_MAX_ATTEMPTS
# retries per check — a single check can legitimately take up to ~90s in
# a realistic worst case. At a real tracked scale of ~24 pincode checks/
# cycle (4 products x 6 pincodes) and MAX_CONCURRENT_CHECKS=4, a full
# cycle's worst case is roughly 24/4 x 90s =~9 minutes — this interval
# needs real margin above that. IMPORTANT: this interval only controls
# how OFTEN a pickup cycle starts, not how long ONE run blocks — bot.py's
# stock_checker_loop is a single sequential loop that awaits
# run_pickup_check_cycle in-line, so every other site's regular
# CHECK_INTERVAL-paced checking is paused for the whole duration of
# whatever pickup cycle is running, every time this interval comes due.
# At this scale that's an infrequent (every 15 min), bounded (~9 min
# worst case) pause — acceptable for now, but NOT eliminated by this
# number alone; only decoupling the pickup cycle into a genuinely
# separate concurrent task would remove the pause entirely, which hasn't
