playwright_scraper/main.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Standalone Playwright + Chromium service, serving two independent purposes
in the main bot's architecture:

1. A pilot scraper for iQOO and Vivo, built to test replacing their current
   Scrape.do render=true checks — those burn render credits at scale; this
   self-hosts the same JS-rendering step behind an optional metered proxy
   instead. NOT wired into the main bot's production checkers (checkers/
   iqoo.py, checkers/vivo.py are untouched) — /check-stock exists purely for
   standalone testing/comparison.
2. The main bot's Apple pickup-checking IS wired to this service, but only
   for periodic cookie refresh (/refresh-apple-cookies, called by bot.py's
   apple_cookie_refresh_loop every APPLE_COOKIE_REFRESH_INTERVAL) — never
   for the actual per-check requests, which stay on plain httpx in the main
   bot for speed. See that endpoint's own section below for why.

ISOLATION: this is a completely separate Railway service — its own
container, its own process, its own requirements.txt (Playwright is NOT a
dependency of the main bot). If this crashes, gets blocked, or a proxy runs
out of quota: /check-stock's iQOO/Vivo pilot is simply unaffected (nothing
in the main bot calls it); /refresh-apple-cookies failing just means the
main bot's stored Apple session goes unrefreshed until the next cycle or
this service recovers — the main bot falls back to whatever session it last
had, then to the APPLE_COOKIES/APPLE_USER_AGENT env vars (see
checkers/apple.py's _resolve_apple_session). Never fatal to the main bot.

HTTP surface:
  POST /check-stock    Body: {"url": str, "store": "iqoo"|"vivo"}. Returns
                        {"url", "store", "in_stock": bool|None, "signal": str,
                        "attempts": int}. in_stock is None ("check failed")
                        when no conclusive signal was found after retrying —
                        NEVER a guessed False, unlike the main bot's own
                        checkers (deliberate: this is a pilot being tuned, an
                        inconclusive read should surface for investigation,
                        not silently default to "out of stock").
  POST /debug-network  Body: {"url": str, "pincode": str (optional, default
                        "110001")}. Applies pincode as a cookie (best-effort
                        — see _capture_network_calls), loads the page, and
                        records every XHR/fetch response whose URL contains
                        a serviceability/delivery/pincode/availability/
                        stock/fulfillment keyword. Returns {"url", "pincode",
                        "matched_requests": [{"url", "method", "status",
                        "body"}...], "total_requests_seen", "matched_count",
                        "all_responses_seen": [{"url","status",
                        "resource_type"}...] (lightweight, every response —
                        not just matches, capped at 100), "diagnostics":
                        {"goto_status", "goto_error", "final_url",
                        "page_title", "page_crashed",
                        "networkidle_timed_out", "networkidle_error",
                        "html_length", "html_snippet", ...} so a silent
                        navigation failure or anti-bot block page is visible
                        in the response, not just a suspiciously low count.
                        For admin diagnostic use (e.g. RelianceDigital's
                        /debugreliance) — hit directly, no auth (matches
                        /check-stock; this whole service has none).
  POST /debug-dom       Body: {"url": str, "click_text": str (optional)}.
                        _capture_network_calls' sibling for DOM STRUCTURE
                        discovery instead of network traffic (see
                        _capture_dom_elements) — loads the page, EXPLICITLY
                        waits for pickUpDetails to appear (observed
                        rendering inconsistently run-to-run — present
                        twice on one capture, absent on the next identical
                        URL — so a fixed dwell alone isn't reliable; see
                        diagnostics.pickup_details_wait_timed_out), then
                        returns every element whose data-autom/text/
                        attributes mention pickup, fulfillment, store, zip,
                        pincode, or location, plus the full outerHTML of
                        any pickUpDetails element(s) AND every plausibly-
                        clickable descendant within it (button/link/
                        role=button/tabindex/onclick/cursor:pointer),
                        regardless of exact text — its real trigger text
                        may vary by state. When click_text is given, also
                        clicks the first element containing that text
                        (case-insensitive) after the initial capture, waits
                        for any resulting modal/overlay to settle, and
                        re-runs the same extraction — returned as
                        "after_click" — so a pincode input hidden behind a
                        click trigger becomes visible without guessing at
                        the modal's own selectors first. Returns {"url",
                        "page_title", "data_autom_elements",
                        "pincode_like_inputs", "pickup_related_buttons",
                        "pickup_details_html", "pickup_details_clickables",
                        "after_click", "diagnostics" (includes
                        "click_result" when click_text was given)}. Built
                        for the 2026-07-27 Apple pickup-widget selector
                        discovery (see checkers/apple.py's
                        investigation notes) — no auth, same as every
                        other endpoint here.
  POST /debug-pickup-flow
                        Body: {"url": str, "pincode": str (optional,
                        default "110001")}. /debug-dom's more targeted
                        successor (see _capture_pickup_flow) — performs
                        the FULL confirmed pincode-check interaction:
                        click the "Check availability" trigger, wait for
                        the overlay, fill pincode into its zipCode input,
                        click Continue, wait for results, then return the
                        overlay's full outerHTML (the actual point — what
                        the result markup looks like) plus the same
                        keyword-filtered DOM scan /debug-dom uses. Returns
                        {"url", "pincode", "overlay_html",
                        "data_autom_elements", "pincode_like_inputs",
                        "pickup_related_buttons", "pickup_details_html",
                        "pickup_details_clickables", "diagnostics"
                        (per-step errors: trigger_click_error,
                        overlay_wait_timed_out, zip_fill_error,
                        continue_click_error, results_wait_timed_out)}.
                        No auth, same as every other endpoint here.
  POST /refresh-apple-cookies
                        Body: {"url": str (an apple.com/<locale>/shop/...
                        product page), "pincode": str}. Loads the page in a
                        real headless-Chromium session, extracts its SKU,
                        and performs an in-page fetch() of Apple's
                        fulfillment-messages endpoint (same query params as
                        the main bot's checkers/apple.py) for `pincode` —
                        this is the exact request Apple's own pickup-
                        availability UI would trigger, run from inside the
                        already-loaded page's JS context so it carries a
                        genuine browser TLS fingerprint, headers, and
                        cookies. Returns {"url", "pincode", "cookies":
                        "name=value; ..." (semicolon-joined, ready to use as
                        a Cookie header), "user_agent": str,
                        "pincode_check_confirmed": bool (True only if that
                        in-page fetch returned HTTP 200 with valid JSON),
                        "diagnostics": {...}}. Requires header
                        "X-Internal-Token: <INTERNAL_REFRESH_TOKEN>" only if
                        that env var is set on this service (unset = no auth,
                        matching every other endpoint's default here). See
                        _refresh_apple_cookies's own docstring for the full
                        reasoning on why this uses an in-page fetch instead
                        of clicking through Apple's pickup UI widget.
  GET  /health         Unauthenticated: {"ok", "max_concurrent_checks",

Stock-detection logic for iqoo/vivo (check_iqoo_vivo_stock, _OOS_PATTERNS,
_offer_availability) is PORTED from checkers/iqoo.py and checkers/vivo.py —
both already probe-confirmed reliable (JSON-LD offers.availability primary,
embedded-JSON fallback, explicit OOS text last resort) against real
in-stock/OOS product pages. This sandbox has no live network access to
verify the signal still holds when sourced via Playwright+proxy instead of
Scrape.do's render=true — see README.md for the live-verification steps
this needs once deployed.

    2026-07-27 UPDATE: the Chrome/Edge VERSION here is now DERIVED from
    `browser.version` (the real, actually-running Chromium build's own
    reported version) rather than a hardcoded string. Original version:
    the Dockerfile's Playwright image sat pinned at v1.47.0 (Chromium
    129, Sept 2024) unchanged since this service was built, while this
    constant hardcoded "Chrome/150.0.0.0 ... Edg/150.0.0.0" — copied from
    a real captured working request — creating a growing, detectable
    engine-vs-claimed-identity mismatch: the TLS/JA3 fingerprint, HTTP/2
    behavior, and JS feature surface all still reflected the real frozen
    Chromium 129 engine no matter what the header claimed. Deriving the
    version here means bumping the Dockerfile's image tag in the future
    automatically keeps this claim honest, with no separate hardcoded
    number to remember to update. Still a custom desktop-shaped UA
    string, not the browser's own raw default (which announces
    "HeadlessChrome" — a strong, well-known bot signal real desktop
    browsers never send) — keeps the Edge-branded template from the real
    working capture, just with an always-accurate version number.

    checkers/apple.py's own sec-ch-ua header (sent later, on the bot
    service's httpx replay of whatever session this mints) derives its
    version the same way — from the User-Agent string actually being
    sent, not a second hardcoded constant — see its _sec_ch_ua_for.

    AFTER launch but before the context (and therefore the UA) is
    created.

    `headless` defaults to the module-wide HEADLESS setting but is
    overridable per-call — added 2026-07-28 for _check_pickup_availability,
    which needs headless=False specifically (see APPLE_PICKUP_HEADLESS):

# /debug-dom: _capture_network_calls' sibling for DOM STRUCTURE discovery
# rather than network traffic — built specifically to find Apple's real
# pincode/pickup-availability widget selectors (2026-07-27 investigation:
# fulfillment-messages never gets a validated Akamai session no matter
# what's sent to it, so the plan shifted to reading the RENDERED PAGE
# instead of replaying an API call — see checkers/apple.py's own notes).
# Neither this sandbox's own outbound fetches (WebFetch) nor the Wayback
# Machine can reach apple.com at all (both blocked outright), so real
# selectors can only come from THIS service's own already-working
# Playwright browser actually loading the page — same reasoning as
# _capture_network_calls existing for RelianceDigital's serviceability
# call instead of guessing at it, and the exact same "verify empirically,
# don't guess" lesson this investigation already learned once with the
# fulfillment-messages param set. Keyword-filtered rather than dumping
# the full DOM (which would be enormous and mostly noise) — every element
# whose data-autom/text/attributes mention pickup, fulfillment, store,
# zip, pincode, or location, since those are the only parts of the page
# actually relevant to this investigation.

    `click_text` (2026-07-27): a real capture found no pincode input on
    initial page load, but DID find a rendered "Check availability" label
    inside pickUpDetails — consistent with the pincode field living behind
    a click-triggered modal/overlay, not on the page from the start. When
    given, this clicks the FIRST element whose text contains `click_text`
    (case-insensitive substring match, via Playwright's own text= locator

# /check-pickup-availability: PRODUCTION pincode-availability check via
# page-render, for Apple's fulfillment-messages API being unusable when
# replayed directly via httpx (see checkers/apple.py's module docstring —
# 0% success across every param/header/cookie combination tried). Scoped
# to iPhone product pages ONLY (the only tracked product category).
#
# ARCHITECTURE (2026-07-28, network-interception rewrite): earlier
# versions of this function scraped the pickup overlay's own rendered
# text, and separately chased why its "Continue" button never visually
# enabled even after correct, error-free pincode entry (see the git
# history on this function for that whole investigation — blur/timing/
# combobox theories, all ruled out with real diagnostic evidence). The
# actual breakthrough: typing a valid pincode makes the page's own JS
# fire pickup-message-recommendations (and fulfillment-messages) AS REAL
# BACKEND CALLS, successfully (200 OK) — carrying genuine in-page session
# context our own httpx replay can never reproduce — regardless of
# whether Continue ever becomes clickable. So this function no longer
# depends on Continue OR on scraping overlay text at all: it registers a
# network-response listener before typing, types the pincode (confirmed
# sufficient on its own to trigger both calls), and parses whichever
# response body arrives directly. pickup-message-recommendations is
# preferred (its shape was confirmed via real captured positive AND
# negative examples); fulfillment-messages is a fallback for if that
# specific endpoint doesn't fire, using the SAME shape/values already
# established and used by checkers/apple.py's own
# _evaluate_pickup_availability for years, not a fresh guess.
#
# ⚠️ REQUIRES headless=False (APPLE_PICKUP_HEADLESS, default off — see
# above). A controlled same-network A/B test confirmed headless Chromium
# fails to render pickUpDetails at all, while headful succeeds
# consistently. The Dockerfile starts a virtual display via start.sh
# (explicit Xvfb + readiness poll) so a headful launch has something to
# render into on Railway's display-less container — confirmed working via
# a real deploy (git_commit_sha-verified) as of the checkpoint diagnostics
# this rewrite is built on top of.
#
# ⚠️ available=False IS a deliberate departure from this codebase's usual
# "never assert False from a pickup-only signal" rule (see
# checkers/apple.py's _evaluate_pickup_availability and its own module
# docstring) — that rule exists because most Indian pincodes have ZERO
# nearby Apple Stores, so "no store shows availability" is normally just
# "no stores nearby," not "checked and out of stock." The distinction
# that makes False defensible HERE: pickup-message-recommendations
# already returns a list of SPECIFIC, NAMED candidate stores for this
# exact pincode. An EMPTY stores list still means "no stores near here at
# all" and stays None (same reasoning as always). But a NON-EMPTY list of
# real stores where none show our SKU as "available" is a materially
# stronger signal — real candidate stores were actually checked, not just
# absent. See _parse_pickup_stores below for exactly where that line is
# drawn.

    network-response listener registered BEFORE page.goto() (even earlier
    than "before typing" — no risk of missing an early-firing call)
    captures whichever of pickup-message-recommendations /
    fulfillment-messages fires, and that response body — not Continue's
    click-ability, not scraped overlay text — is what gets parsed. See
    the module note above this function for the full architecture
    rationale and the available=False caveat.

    SKU is read from the trigger's own data-autom="productLocatorTriggerLink_
    <SKU>" attribute when available (diagnostics["sku_source"] =
    "trigger_data_autom") — confirmed more reliable than the generic
    page-content regex fallback (diagnostics["sku"] set once early,
    unconditionally, as a fallback for the already_resolved state which
    has no such attribute to read): a real run showed the regex grabbing
    a DIFFERENT sku than this same trigger's own attribute had shown for
    the IDENTICAL product URL on an earlier run, most likely because the
    page contains multiple "partNumber" occurrences (related/accessory
    items) and the regex takes whichever appears first in page source,
    not necessarily the one this specific widget is checking.

    diagnostics["all_responses_seen"] records every XHR/fetch URL+status
    observed regardless of whether it matched either strict marker above
    — added after a real run showed response_wait_timed_out=True on a
    URL that HAD produced a real 200 OK just minutes earlier via
    _diagnose_zipcode_validation's much broader keyword match, so a
    future recurrence is directly diagnosable instead of another guess.

    Every step failure is captured into `diagnostics` rather than raising
    — same "capture the failure mode, don't hide it" philosophy as every
    other function in this file.

    NOTE: does NOT acquire _check_semaphore itself — the retry wrapper
    (_check_pickup_availability, below) acquires it once for the whole
    attempt sequence, not once per attempt.

    Retry wrapper around _check_pickup_availability_once (2026-07-28,
    added as a pragmatic safety net for genuinely inconsistent Apple-side
    behavior confirmed across multiple real runs — sometimes pickUpDetails
    renders slowly [pickup_details_wait_timed_out], sometimes the pincode
    lookup's backend call takes variable time or never fires in the
    allotted window [response_wait_timed_out], sometimes a response body
    arrives in a shape _parse_pickup_stores doesn't expect [parse_error].
    Each failure mode individually confirmed via diagnostics on separate
    real runs, not assumed — chasing every one as its own timing edge
    case stopped being productive, so this retries the WHOLE check
    (fresh browser + fresh navigation per attempt, not just the in-page
    type/wait step — a stale page/session is itself a plausible part of
    the intermittency) up to APPLE_PICKUP_MAX_ATTEMPTS times.

    Modeled on bot.py's run_apple_cookie_refresh_cycle
    (APPLE_COOKIE_REFRESH_MAX_ATTEMPTS / _RETRY_DELAY_*): stops early the
    moment one attempt returns a CONCLUSIVE result (available is True or
    False — both real signals in this endpoint's contract, see the
    module note above _parse_pickup_stores on why False is meaningful
    here specifically). If every attempt stays inconclusive (available
    stays None), the LAST attempt's full result is returned as the floor
    — same "genuinely tried to do better first, but never worse than a
    single attempt" behavior as the cookie-refresh precedent.

    Acquires _check_semaphore ONCE for the whole attempt sequence (not
    once per attempt) — this is one logical caller-facing check, and
    holding the slot across retries avoids re-queuing behind unrelated
    concurrent checks between attempts.

    diagnostics["attempt"] / diagnostics["max_attempts"] are added to
    the returned result (on top of whatever _check_pickup_availability_
    once already set) so a result is self-describing about how many

# /debug-zipcode-validation: evidence-gathering diagnostic for WHY
# Continue stays disabled after typing pincode into zipCode
# (_check_pickup_availability's remaining open bug, 2026-07-28) — the
# keystroke-simulation fix (press_sequentially instead of fill()) did NOT
# resolve it, confirmed via a real deploy (git_commit_sha-verified). A
# per-keystroke trajectory capture then RULED OUT the typing-truncation
# theory too: a real run showed all 6 characters landing correctly
# ("110017" exact), focus staying on the field throughout, and NO visible
# error text — yet Continue stayed disabled across every blur/timing
# checkpoint. This tests, in order, stopping at the first checkpoint
# where Continue actually becomes enabled:
#   A. immediately after typing (reproduces the confirmed-still-broken
#      production behavior)
#   F. a real Enter keypress — NOT yet tested before 2026-07-28 round 2;
#      the standard way to CONFIRM a typed value in a combobox/
#      autocomplete-style field, distinct from blur/tab. Tested right
#      after A since it's the most natural next action a real user takes
#      after finishing typing.
#   B. after an extra 500ms dwell with no further interaction (tests
#      "debounced validation, no blur needed")
#   E. after a much longer 5s dwell, STILL no blur (isolates "just needs
#      more time" — e.g. a slow async validation call — from "needs a
#      blur/focus-change event specifically", which B's 500ms alone
#      can't rule out)
#   C. after an explicit programmatic .blur() on the zipCode input
#      (tests "needs blur specifically")
#   D. after a REAL keyboard Tab press away from the field — tests
#      whether React's synthetic blur handling differs for a genuine
#      user-driven focus change vs. a programmatic .blur() call. NOT a
#      positional click (an earlier version clicked near the overlay's
#      top-left corner, which very likely landed on the backdrop's
#      click-to-dismiss zone and closed the whole overlay instead of
#      blurring the field — a bug in the diagnostic itself, not a
#      discovery about Apple's page; Tab has no coordinates to get wrong)
# A network-response listener is also registered before typing starts,
# capturing every XHR/fetch response seen from that point on (method,
# URL, status — no keyword filter, since the whole point is not having
# to guess an endpoint name in advance) — tests whether Continue's
# enablement is gated on an async backend call rather than purely local
# field validation.
#
# Every checkpoint's full state is captured (not just enabled/disabled),
# plus STATIC evidence independent of the sequence:
#   - zipCode's own HTML validation attributes (pattern/maxlength/
#     minlength/inputmode/type — rules a format mismatch in vs out)
#   - React's own attached event-handler prop names on the zipCode
#     element (via its internal __reactProps*/__reactEventHandlers* key —
#     confirms which synthetic events the page actually listens for)
#   - combobox/autocomplete evidence (2026-07-28 round 2, after correct,
#     error-free typing STILL left Continue disabled): zipCode's own
#     role/aria-autocomplete/aria-expanded/aria-activedescendant/
#     aria-controls attributes, plus whether any [role="listbox"]/
#     [role="option"] elements exist anywhere on the page — tests
#     whether this is actually a combobox requiring a SUGGESTION to be
#     selected, not free text accepted as typed
#   - a full inventory of every input/select/button inside the overlay
#     (tag, type, data-autom, name, value/checked, disabled) — rules out
#     "something OTHER than zipCode also gates Continue" without having
#     to guess what to look for

# acquisition via Playwright instead of the main bot's plain httpx calls
# (httpx's TLS fingerprint doesn't match a real browser's, which is part of

# the main bot's checkers/apple.py and config.py for that history).

# UI would do once submitted: call fulfillment-messages with the page's own
# SKU and the given pincode. Same endpoint, same query params
# (checkers/apple.py's _build_fulfillment_target), same authentication
# (page-context fetch = real browser Cookie/UA), without depending on

    2026-07-27 — _abck's raw VALUE (not just its name/presence, unlike
    every other cookie in the jar — see _refresh_apple_cookies' own
    cookie_names diagnostic) is surfaced here specifically. Safe to:
    _abck is Akamai Bot Manager's own anti-bot sensor/telemetry marker,
    not an account/session credential — it grants no access to anything
    on apple.com by itself, unlike the real session cookies (dssid2,
    as_atb, mbox, etc.) that make up the rest of this jar, which stay
    name-only for exactly that reason.

    Motivation: akamai_markers_present only proves the cookie EXISTS, not
    that Akamai actually validated the session behind it — a cookie can
    be present but still reflect an unvalidated/rejected state. Community
    reverse-engineering of Akamai's _abck format (not officially
    published by Akamai, not verified against Apple's specific
    configuration — treat as a lead to check, not a confirmed fact)
    commonly describes it as roughly
    "<sensor_uid>~<validation_flag>~<payload>~<flag>~<flag>", with the
    SECOND field (right after the first "~") reportedly "-1" when the
    sensor's data hasn't been accepted/validated yet, vs. a different
    value once it has. Returned split on "~" so that field is directly
    visible per refresh cycle instead of guessing from presence alone.

    Returns {"abck_value_raw": str|None, "abck_segments": list[str]|None}
    — both None if no _abck cookie was captured at all this cycle.

       "user_agent": <the UA this browser context used>,
       "pincode_check_confirmed": bool,  # fulfillment-messages returned a

       "diagnostics": {...}}
    cookies/user_agent are still returned even when pincode_check_confirmed
    is False (e.g. SKU extraction failed, or the fetch itself errored) —
    the page load alone still mints real anti-bot/session cookies, which
    may still be usable; the caller (the main bot) can decide whether an
    unconfirmed refresh is worth storing. Never raises for anything short
    of a hard Playwright/browser failure (navigation errors, missing SKU,
    and fetch failures are all captured in diagnostics instead).

    Deliberately slower than /check-stock's _render_page: diagnostic
    logging (see akamai_markers_present below) confirmed an earlier
    version of this function — which captured cookies immediately after
    domcontentloaded, blocked images/fonts/stylesheets, and closed the
    browser right after the fetch — produced a session with NONE of
    Akamai Bot Manager's own marker cookies (_abck/bm_sz/ak_bmsc) present
    at all. Akamai never validated the session in the first place, which
    is almost certainly why it died in ~9 minutes rather than the ~2
    hours a manually-copied, actively-used real browser session showed.
    This version gives that validation JS room to actually run: a
    bounded networkidle wait, a dwell period BEFORE the fulfillment
    fetch (not just before cookie extraction), no resource blocking (so
    every subresource the real page would load, loads), and a brief
